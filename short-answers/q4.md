# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

I would want to use `.innerHTML` when I need to set or get an existing piece of HTML content of an element or when I want to replace that content entirely with a new HTML structure. I would use `.createElement` when I want to dynamically create an element in the DOM as people interact with the User Interface and/or when I need to have a lot of control over attributes and properties.
