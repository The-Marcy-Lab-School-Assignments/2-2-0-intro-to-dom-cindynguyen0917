# Question

What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

`.innerText` will return the text content of an element but exclude the content of script and style tags. `.innerText` also follows CSS styling and will not show any text that is hidden by CSS. `.textContent` however is the opposite and returns the full text content regardless of any CSS styling or tags.
